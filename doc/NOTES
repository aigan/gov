A key aspect of the web is the ability to give tools for better informed decisions. Easier evaluation of facts and reasoning. This can happen collectively without any fixed authority, but in a way that will make it clear and easy to find the facts and logic.

A key aspect of "liquid democracy" is the delegation to trusted decision makers. The model used in "Aktiv Demokrati" is that you can delegate to as many delegates as you like. It can be different delegates for different topics. A single person may have delegated to hundreds of different delegates that in many cases will vote on the same things.

One source of information is the overview of the stances of YOUR delegates in each specific question, along with their arguments and their sources and links to discussions.

Another source is "LIQUID ADVISERS". They may be a decision maker, but you only select them for giving you information in a question, without delegating your vote to them. You will see their stance in each question, with arguments and links to sources and discussions.

"LIQUID ADVISERS" also includes FACT SOURCES. They may not have a stance for the question, but they give you the material for basing the conclusions. The advicers may include organisations that does statistical compilations and other research organisations.

A "delegate" or "adviser" may be another person, a political party or an organisation. But it may also be an algoritm or any type of program. That means that you are free to construct your own way to gather information from delegates or from any source you can think of, and arrive at your own conclusion.

"Liquid" refers to the system of cascade delegation. A delegate or adviser may use one or many other delegates or advisers, that may in turn use other sources.

The web makes it possible to present all this information in a clear way and to sort it based on who you trust and respect.
